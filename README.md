## Getting the app
This app requires Windows 11 and [.NET Desktop Runtime 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-9.0.5-windows-x64-installer).

1. Install it from [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PCKT2B7DZMW) or search the store for "Battery Percentage Icon" if you prefer an effortless always up-to-date app experience.
2. Manually download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/soleon/Percentage/releases) page if you prefer a portable self-contained single exe file.
   * Note that to use the in-app auto start setting, you need to run the app as a Microsoft Store app.
   * Otherwise, you need to manually create a shortcut of the app in your start menu startup folder located at: `C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`.

GitHub releases are often a few hours or days prior to the Microsoft Store release because store apps must go through Microsoft certification process.
